# Coffee Sales Dashboard -- Excel Project 

This is a practice data visualization and analytics project focused on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing sales data from a mythical coffee company. This project features an interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights into customer behavior, product sales, and regional performance.

## Overview 

This project began with two data sources: 
- Customers Sheet: Contains customer information such as names, contact details, location, and loyalty card status.
- Products Sheet: Contains information about various coffee products including type, roast, size, pricing, and profit.

From these sheets, I created a dataset called CoffeeSales which aggregates customer and product data for further analysis.
